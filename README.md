Tasties is a captivating restaurant webpage that I crafted with a blend of HTML, CSS, and Javascript, serving as a remarkable addition to my front-end portfolio. With a tasteful design, it offers visitors a visual feast, inviting them to explore the culinary delights of a fictional restaurant. The site showcases my proficiency in front-end development, combining responsive design and interactive elements to enhance the user experience. Dive into Tasties and let me know what you think! Note: This is not a real restaurant and is only a concept of one.
